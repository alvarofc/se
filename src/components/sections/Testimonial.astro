    ‚Äú Loved every minute of it! The bbq, with good friends, paella, 4th of July madness, impromptu magician, of course! But also breakfast and sharing a meal with great entrepreneurs, amazing conversations, sharing experiences and enthusiasm with people from over the world. It was so intense! A lot of the success of my stay in the Bay Area has been thanks to this place. I would call it ‚Äúthe serendipity house‚Äù!‚Äù

    ‚Äú Startup Embassy is THE place to stay in Silicon Valley. If you are a tech entrepreneur and you like meeting people from all around the world you would love staying here and you won¬¥t regret it. I stayed here for 2 weeks and had a great time. The networking opportunities are huge. The place is really clean and very well located. I'm already missing the place and really look forward to come back soon. ‚Äù
