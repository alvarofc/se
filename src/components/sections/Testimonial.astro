    ‚Äú Loved every minute of it! The bbq, with good friends, paella, 4th of July madness, impromptu magician, of course! But also breakfast and sharing a meal with great entrepreneurs, amazing conversations, sharing experiences and enthusiasm with people from over the world. It was so intense! A lot of the success of my stay in the Bay Area has been thanks to this place. I would call it ‚Äúthe serendipity house‚Äù!‚Äù

    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
    Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

    ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
    really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be
    able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
    developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
    attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing
    people. ‚Äù

    Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

  <blockquote class="text-sm text-[var(--very-dark-blackish-blue-50)]">
    ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
    needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
    of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
    entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
    and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
    particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
    way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
    during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
    certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
    multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
